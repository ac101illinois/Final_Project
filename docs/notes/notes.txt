1. Key Lessons Learned:

I had never done anything like what we've learned in class before, so I am taking away a lot! Mainly I've
learned how all the models, views and urls work with each other and what they specifically do for the website.

I've also learned a lot about pycharm and how to utulize the terminal effectively.

For this specific project, I learned a lot about bootstrap and how to implement CSS effectively in my site.

2. Challenges Faced:

I had a really hard time with my UI, expecially since I was wanting to access multiple APIs and display the
results for each of them on my site. There are still some things I want to change, but I am trying not to be
picky at this point.

3. Future Improvements:

I would love to expand the functiions available on my website. I want to make it so that the user can add
and delete custom lists, add/edit the dates a book was read, and add a spinner page do they can decide
their next read.
