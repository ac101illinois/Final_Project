1. Project overview

My website is designed to help readers/book buyers manage their physical library
and motivate them to read through the books they own before they buy more. They can
search through every book and add the edition they own to their books, and then
change the status on each of the books they own, whether or not they've read them or
if they are reading it right now. It also lets them track their reading progress on
their current read.

2. Both of these logins have been added to admin and the website:
Internal tester's login credentials: mohitg2 / graingerlibrary
